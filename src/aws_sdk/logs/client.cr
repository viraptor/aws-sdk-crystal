      # CloudWatch Logs query insights results in the account. When you use AssociateKmsKey , you specify
      # either the logGroupName parameter or the resourceIdentifier parameter. You can't specify both of
      # those parameters in the same operation. Specify the logGroupName parameter to cause log events
      # ingested into that log group to be encrypted with that key. Only the log events ingested after the
      # key is associated are encrypted with that key. Associating a KMS key with a log group overrides any
      # existing associations between the log group and a KMS key. After a KMS key is associated with a log
      # group, all newly ingested data for the log group is encrypted using the KMS key. This association is
      # stored as long as the data encrypted with the KMS key is still within CloudWatch Logs. This enables
      # CloudWatch Logs to decrypt this data whenever it is requested. Associating a key with a log group
      # does not cause the results of queries of that log group to be encrypted with that key. To have query
      # results encrypted with a KMS key, you must use an AssociateKmsKey operation with the
      # resourceIdentifier parameter that specifies a query-result resource. Specify the resourceIdentifier
      # parameter with a query-result resource, to use that key to encrypt the stored results of all future
      # StartQuery operations in the account. The response from a GetQueryResults operation will still
      # return the query results in plain text. Even if you have not associated a key with your query
      # results, the query results are encrypted when stored, using the default CloudWatch Logs method. If
      # you run a query from a monitoring account that queries logs in a source account, the query results

      # events or log group query results, then all the associated stored log events or query results that

      # example, if the result of a query would return 15,000 log events, the first page isn't guaranteed to
      # have 10,000 log events even if they all fit into 1 MB. Partially full or empty pages don't

      # Creates an account-level data protection policy, subscription filter policy, field index policy,
      # transformer policy, or metric extraction policy that applies to all log groups, a subset of log
      # groups, or a data source name and type combination in the account. For field index policies, you can
      # configure indexed fields as facets to enable interactive exploration of your logs. Facets provide
      # value distributions and counts for indexed fields in the CloudWatch Logs Insights console without
      # requiring query execution. For more information, see Use facets to group and explore logs . To use
      # this operation, you must be signed on with the correct permissions depending on the type of policy
      # that you are creating. To create a data protection policy, you must have the
      # logs:PutDataProtectionPolicy and logs:PutAccountPolicy permissions. To create a subscription filter
      # policy, you must have the logs:PutSubscriptionFilter and logs:PutAccountPolicy permissions. To
      # create a transformer policy, you must have the logs:PutTransformer and logs:PutAccountPolicy
      # permissions. To create a field index policy, you must have the logs:PutIndexPolicy and
      # logs:PutAccountPolicy permissions. To configure facets for field index policies, you must have the
      # logs:PutIndexPolicy and logs:PutAccountPolicy permissions. To create a metric extraction policy, you
      # must have the logs:PutMetricExtractionPolicy and logs:PutAccountPolicy permissions. Data protection
      # policy A data protection policy can help safeguard sensitive data that's ingested by your log groups
      # by auditing and masking the sensitive log data. Each account can have only one account-level data
      # protection policy. Sensitive data is detected and masked when it is ingested into a log group. When
      # you set a data protection policy, log events ingested into the log groups before that time are not
      # masked. If you use PutAccountPolicy to create a data protection policy for your whole account, it
      # applies to both existing log groups and all log groups that are created later in this account. The
      # account-level policy is applied to existing log groups with eventual consistency. It might take up
      # to 5 minutes before sensitive data in existing log groups begins to be masked. By default, when a
      # user views a log event that includes masked data, the sensitive data is replaced by asterisks. A
      # user who has the logs:Unmask permission can use a GetLogEvents or FilterLogEvents operation with the
      # unmask parameter set to true to view the unmasked log events. Users with the logs:Unmask can also
      # view unmasked data in the CloudWatch Logs console by running a CloudWatch Logs Insights query with
      # the unmask query command. For more information, including a list of types of data that can be
      # audited and masked, see Protect sensitive log data with masking . To use the PutAccountPolicy
      # operation for a data protection policy, you must be signed on with the logs:PutDataProtectionPolicy
      # and logs:PutAccountPolicy permissions. The PutAccountPolicy operation applies to all log groups in
      # the account. You can use PutDataProtectionPolicy to create a data protection policy that applies to
      # just one log group. If a log group has its own data protection policy and the account also has an
      # account-level data protection policy, then the two policies are cumulative. Any sensitive term
      # specified in either policy is masked. Subscription filter policy A subscription filter policy sets
      # up a real-time feed of log events from CloudWatch Logs to other Amazon Web Services services.
      # Account-level subscription filter policies apply to both existing log groups and log groups that are
      # created later in this account. Supported destinations are Kinesis Data Streams, Firehose, and
      # Lambda. When log events are sent to the receiving service, they are Base64 encoded and compressed
      # with the GZIP format. The following destinations are supported for subscription filters: An Kinesis
      # Data Streams data stream in the same account as the subscription policy, for same-account delivery.
      # An Firehose data stream in the same account as the subscription policy, for same-account delivery. A
      # Lambda function in the same account as the subscription policy, for same-account delivery. A logical
      # destination in a different account created with PutDestination , for cross-account delivery. Kinesis
      # Data Streams and Firehose are supported as logical destinations. Each account can have one
      # account-level subscription filter policy per Region. If you are updating an existing filter, you
      # must specify the correct name in PolicyName . To perform a PutAccountPolicy subscription filter
      # operation for any destination except a Lambda function, you must also have the iam:PassRole
      # permission. Transformer policy Creates or updates a log transformer policy for your account. You use
      # log transformers to transform log events into a different format, making them easier for you to
      # process and analyze. You can also transform logs from different sources into standardized formats
      # that contain relevant, source-specific information. After you have created a transformer, CloudWatch
      # Logs performs this transformation at the time of log ingestion. You can then refer to the
      # transformed versions of the logs during operations such as querying with CloudWatch Logs Insights or
      # creating metric filters or subscription filters. You can also use a transformer to copy metadata
      # from metadata keys into the log events themselves. This metadata can include log group name, log
      # stream name, account ID and Region. A transformer for a log group is a series of processors, where
      # each processor applies one type of transformation to the log events ingested into this log group.
      # For more information about the available processors to use in a transformer, see Processors that you
      # can use . Having log events in standardized format enables visibility across your applications for
      # your log analysis, reporting, and alarming needs. CloudWatch Logs provides transformation for common
      # log types with out-of-the-box transformation templates for major Amazon Web Services log sources
      # such as VPC flow logs, Lambda, and Amazon RDS. You can use pre-built transformation templates or
      # create custom transformation policies. You can create transformers only for the log groups in the
      # Standard log class. You can have one account-level transformer policy that applies to all log groups
      # in the account. Or you can create as many as 20 account-level transformer policies that are each
      # scoped to a subset of log groups with the selectionCriteria parameter. If you have multiple
      # account-level transformer policies with selection criteria, no two of them can use the same or
      # overlapping log group name prefixes. For example, if you have one policy filtered to log groups that
      # start with my-log , you can't have another transformer policy filtered to my-logpprod or my-logging
      # . You can also set up a transformer at the log-group level. For more information, see PutTransformer
      # . If there is both a log-group level transformer created with PutTransformer and an account-level
      # transformer that could apply to the same log group, the log group uses only the log-group level
      # transformer. It ignores the account-level transformer. Field index policy You can use field index
      # policies to create indexes on fields found in log events for a log group or data source name and
      # type combination. Creating field indexes can help lower the scan volume for CloudWatch Logs Insights
      # queries that reference those fields, because these queries attempt to skip the processing of log
      # events that are known to not match the indexed field. Good fields to index are fields that you often
      # need to query for and fields or values that match only a small fraction of the total log events.
      # Common examples of indexes include request ID, session ID, user IDs, or instance IDs. For more
      # information, see Create field indexes to improve query performance and reduce costs To find the
      # fields that are in your log group events, use the GetLogGroupFields operation. To find the fields
      # for a data source use the GetLogFields operation. For example, suppose you have created a field
      # index for requestId . Then, any CloudWatch Logs Insights query on that log group that includes
      # requestId = value or requestId in [ value , value , ...] will attempt to process only the log events
      # where the indexed field matches the specified value. Matches of log events to the names of indexed
      # fields are case-sensitive. For example, an indexed field of RequestId won't match a log event
      # containing requestId . You can have one account-level field index policy that applies to all log
      # groups in the account. Or you can create as many as 20 account-level field index policies that are
      # each scoped to a subset of log groups using LogGroupNamePrefix with the selectionCriteria parameter.
      # You can have another 20 account-level field index policies using DataSourceName and DataSourceType
      # for the selectionCriteria parameter. If you have multiple account-level index policies with
      # LogGroupNamePrefix selection criteria, no two of them can use the same or overlapping log group name
      # prefixes. For example, if you have one policy filtered to log groups that start with my-log , you
      # can't have another field index policy filtered to my-logpprod or my-logging . Similarly, if you have
      # multiple account-level index policies with DataSourceName and DataSourceType selection criteria, no
      # two of them can use the same data source name and type combination. For example, if you have one
      # policy filtered to the data source name amazon_vpc and data source type flow you cannot create
      # another policy with this combination. If you create an account-level field index policy in a
      # monitoring account in cross-account observability, the policy is applied only to the monitoring
      # account and not to any source accounts. CloudWatch Logs provides default field indexes for all log
      # groups in the Standard log class. Default field indexes are automatically available for the
      # following fields: @logStream @aws.region @aws.account @source.log @data_source_name
      # @data_source_type @data_format traceId severityText attributes.session.id CloudWatch Logs provides
      # default field indexes for certain data source name and type combinations as well. Default field
      # indexes are automatically available for the following data source name and type combinations as
      # identified in the following list: amazon_vpc.flow action logStatus region flowDirection type
      # amazon_route53.resolver_query transport rcode aws_waf.access action httpRequest.country
      # aws_cloudtrail.data , aws_cloudtrail.management eventSource eventName awsRegion userAgent errorCode
      # eventType managementEvent readOnly eventCategory requestId Default field indexes are in addition to
      # any custom field indexes you define within your policy. Default field indexes are not counted
      # towards your field index quota . If you want to create a field index policy for a single log group,
      # you can use PutIndexPolicy instead of PutAccountPolicy . If you do so, that log group will use that
      # log-group level policy and any account-level policies that match at the data source level; any
      # account-level policy that matches at the log group level (for example, no selection criteria or log
      # group name prefix selection criteria) will be ignored. Metric extraction policy A metric extraction
      # policy controls whether CloudWatch Metrics can be created through the Embedded Metrics Format (EMF)
      # for log groups in your account. By default, EMF metric creation is enabled for all log groups. You
      # can use metric extraction policies to disable EMF metric creation for your entire account or
      # specific log groups. When a policy disables EMF metric creation for a log group, log events in the
      # EMF format are still ingested, but no CloudWatch Metrics are created from them. Creating a policy
      # disables metrics for AWS features that use EMF to create metrics, such as CloudWatch Container
      # Insights and CloudWatch Application Signals. To prevent turning off those features by accident, we
      # recommend that you exclude the underlying log-groups through a selection-criteria such as
      # LogGroupNamePrefix NOT IN ["/aws/containerinsights", "/aws/ecs/containerinsights",
      # "/aws/application-signals/data"] . Each account can have either one account-level metric extraction
      # policy that applies to all log groups, or up to 5 policies that are each scoped to a subset of log
      # groups with the selectionCriteria parameter. The selection criteria supports filtering by
      # LogGroupName and LogGroupNamePrefix using the operators IN and NOT IN . You can specify up to 50
      # values in each IN or NOT IN list. The selection criteria can be specified in these formats:
      # LogGroupName IN ["log-group-1", "log-group-2"] LogGroupNamePrefix NOT IN ["/aws/prefix1",
      # "/aws/prefix2"] If you have multiple account-level metric extraction policies with selection
      # criteria, no two of them can have overlapping criteria. For example, if you have one policy with
      # selection criteria LogGroupNamePrefix IN ["my-log"] , you can't have another metric extraction
      # policy with selection criteria LogGroupNamePrefix IN ["/my-log-prod"] or LogGroupNamePrefix IN
      # ["/my-logging"] , as the set of log groups matching these prefixes would be a subset of the log
      # groups matching the first policy's prefix, creating an overlap. When using NOT IN , only one policy
      # with this operator is allowed per account. When combining policies with IN and NOT IN operators, the
      # overlap check ensures that policies don't have conflicting effects. Two policies with IN and NOT IN
      # operators do not overlap if and only if every value in the IN policy is completely contained within
      # some value in the NOT IN policy. For example: If you have a NOT IN policy for prefix "/aws/lambda" ,
      # you can create an IN policy for the exact log group name "/aws/lambda/function1" because the set of
      # log groups matching "/aws/lambda/function1" is a subset of the log groups matching "/aws/lambda" .
      # If you have a NOT IN policy for prefix "/aws/lambda" , you cannot create an IN policy for prefix
      # "/aws" because the set of log groups matching "/aws" is not a subset of the log groups matching
      # "/aws/lambda" .

      # Creates or updates a field index policy for the specified log group. Only log groups in the Standard
      # log class support field index policies. For more information about log classes, see Log classes .
      # You can use field index policies to create field indexes on fields found in log events in the log
      # group. Creating field indexes speeds up and lowers the costs for CloudWatch Logs Insights queries
      # that reference those field indexes, because these queries attempt to skip the processing of log
      # events that are known to not match the indexed field. Good fields to index are fields that you often
      # need to query for and fields or values that match only a small fraction of the total log events.
      # Common examples of indexes include request ID, session ID, userID, and instance IDs. For more
      # information, see Create field indexes to improve query performance and reduce costs . You can
      # configure indexed fields as facets to enable interactive exploration and filtering of your logs in
      # the CloudWatch Logs Insights console. Facets allow you to view value distributions and counts for
      # indexed fields without running queries. When you create a field index, you can optionally set it as
      # a facet to enable this interactive analysis capability. For more information, see Use facets to
      # group and explore logs . To find the fields that are in your log group events, use the
      # GetLogGroupFields operation. For example, suppose you have created a field index for requestId .
      # Then, any CloudWatch Logs Insights query on that log group that includes requestId = value or
      # requestId IN [ value , value , ...] will process fewer log events to reduce costs, and have improved
      # performance. CloudWatch Logs provides default field indexes for all log groups in the Standard log
      # class. Default field indexes are automatically available for the following fields: @logStream
      # @aws.region @aws.account @source.log traceId Default field indexes are in addition to any custom
      # field indexes you define within your policy. Default field indexes are not counted towards your
      # field index quota. Each index policy has the following quotas and restrictions: As many as 20 fields
      # can be included in the policy. Each field name can include as many as 100 characters. Matches of log
      # events to the names of indexed fields are case-sensitive. For example, a field index of RequestId
      # won't match a log event containing requestId . Log group-level field index policies created with
      # PutIndexPolicy override account-level field index policies created with PutAccountPolicy that apply
      # to log groups. If you use PutIndexPolicy to create a field index policy for a log group, that log
      # group uses only that policy for log group-level indexing, including any facet configurations. The

      # Creates or updates a log transformer for a single log group. You use log transformers to transform
