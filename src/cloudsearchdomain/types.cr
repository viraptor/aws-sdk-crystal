        # corresponding operators ( + , | , - ) have no special meaning and are dropped from the search

        # precedence disables the ability to control order of precedence using parentheses. Disabling near
        # disables the ability to use the ~ operator to perform a sloppy phrase search. Disabling the fuzzy
        # operator disables the ability to use the ~ operator to perform a fuzzy search. escape disables the
        # ability to use a backslash ( \ ) to escape special characters within the search string. Disabling
        # whitespace is an advanced option that prevents the parser from tokenizing on whitespace, which can
        # be useful for Vietnamese. (It prevents Vietnamese words from being split incorrectly.) For example,
        # you could disable all operators other than the phrase operator to support just simple term and

        # characters are enabled. Valid for: simple . phraseFields : An array of the text or text-array fields
        # you want to use for phrase searches. When the terms in the search string appear in close proximity
        # within a field, the field scores higher. You can specify a weight for each field to boost that

        # still be boosted. To specify a field weight, append a caret ( ^ ) symbol and the weight to the field
        # name. For example, to boost phrase matches in the title field over the abstract field, you could
        # specify: "phraseFields":["title^3", "plot"] Valid values: The name of any text or text-array field
        # and an optional numeric value greater than zero. Default: No fields. If you don't specify any fields
        # with phraseFields , proximity scoring is disabled even if phraseSlop is specified. Valid for: dismax

        # and still be boosted according to the weights specified in the phraseFields option; for example,
        # phraseSlop: 2 . You must also specify phraseFields to enable proximity scoring. Valid values:
        # positive integers. Default: 0. Valid for: dismax . explicitPhraseSlop : An integer value that
        # specifies how much a match can deviate from the search phrase when the phrase is enclosed in double
        # quotes in the search string. (Phrases that exceed this proximity distance are not considered a
        # match.) For example, to specify a slop of three for dismax phrase queries, you would specify
        # "explicitPhraseSlop":3 . Valid values: positive integers. Default: 0. Valid for: dismax . tieBreaker
        # : When a term in the search string is found in a document's field, a score is calculated for that
        # field based on how common the word is in that field compared to other documents. If the term occurs
        # in multiple fields within a document, by default only the highest scoring field contributes to the
        # document's overall score. You can specify a tieBreaker value to enable the matches in lower-scoring
        # fields to contribute to the document's score. That way, if two documents have the same max field
        # score for a particular term, the score for the document that has matches in more fields will be
        # higher. The formula for calculating the score with a tieBreaker is (max field score) + (tieBreaker)
