        # continually updated with the latest fragments as they become available. We recommend that the media
        # player retrieve a new playlist on a one-second interval. When this type of session is played in a
        # media player, the user interface typically displays a "live" notification, with no scrubber control
        # for choosing the position in the playback window to display. In LIVE mode, the newest available
        # fragments are included in an HLS media playlist, even if there is a gap between fragments (that is,
        # if a fragment is missing). A gap like this might cause a media player to halt or cause a jump in
        # playback. In this mode, fragments are not added to the HLS media playlist if they are older than the
        # newest fragment in the playlist. If the missing fragment becomes available after a subsequent
        # fragment is added to the playlist, the older fragment is not added, and the gap is not filled.
        # LIVE_REPLAY : For sessions of this type, the HLS media playlist is updated similarly to how it is
        # updated for LIVE mode except that it starts by including fragments from a given start time. Instead
        # of fragments being added as they are ingested, fragments are added as the duration of the next
        # fragment elapses. For example, if the fragments in the session are two seconds long, then a new
        # fragment is added to the media playlist every two seconds. This mode is useful to be able to start
        # playback from when an event is detected and continue live streaming media that has not yet been
        # ingested as of the time of the session creation. This mode is also useful to stream previously
        # archived media without being limited by the 1,000 fragment limit in the ON_DEMAND mode. ON_DEMAND :
