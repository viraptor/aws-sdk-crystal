      # through the manifest consists only of the requested stream, time range, and format. No other media
      # data (such as frames outside the requested window or alternate bitrates) is made available. Provide
      # the URL (containing the encrypted session token) for the MPEG-DASH manifest to a media player that
      # supports the MPEG-DASH protocol. Kinesis Video Streams makes the initialization fragment and media
      # fragments available through the manifest URL. The initialization fragment contains the codec private
      # data for the stream, and other data needed to set up the video or audio decoder and renderer. The
      # media fragments contain encoded video frames or encoded audio samples. The media player receives the
      # authenticated URL and requests stream metadata and media data normally. When the media player
      # requests data, it calls the following actions: GetDASHManifest: Retrieves an MPEG DASH manifest,
      # which contains the metadata for the media that you want to playback. GetMP4InitFragment: Retrieves
      # the MP4 initialization fragment. The media player typically loads the initialization fragment before
      # loading any media fragments. This fragment contains the " fytp " and " moov " MP4 atoms, and the
      # child atoms that are needed to initialize the media player decoder. The initialization fragment does
      # not correspond to a fragment in a Kinesis video stream. It contains only the codec private data for
      # the stream and respective track, which the media player needs to decode the media frames.
      # GetMP4MediaFragment: Retrieves MP4 media fragments. These fragments contain the " moof " and " mdat
      # " MP4 atoms and their child atoms, containing the encoded fragment's media frames and their
      # timestamps. After the first media fragment is made available in a streaming session, any fragments
      # that don't contain the same codec private data cause an error to be returned when those different
      # media fragments are loaded. Therefore, the codec private data should not change between fragments in
      # a session. This also means that the session fails if the fragments in a stream change from having
      # only video to having both audio and video. Data retrieved with this action is billable. See Pricing

      # Retrieves an HLS media playlist, which contains a URL to access the MP4 initialization fragment with
      # the GetMP4InitFragment action, and URLs to access the MP4 media fragments with the
      # GetMP4MediaFragment actions. The HLS media playlist also contains metadata about the stream that the

      # distinct HLS media playlist for the video track and the audio track (if applicable) that contains
      # MP4 media URLs for the specific track. GetMP4InitFragment: Retrieves the MP4 initialization
      # fragment. The media player typically loads the initialization fragment before loading any media
      # fragments. This fragment contains the " fytp " and " moov " MP4 atoms, and the child atoms that are

      # fragment is made available in a streaming session, fragments can contain CPD changes for each track.
      # Therefore, the fragments in a session can have a different resolution, bit rate, or other
      # information in the CPD without interrupting playback. However, any change made in the track number
      # or track codec format can return an error when those different media fragments are loaded. For
      # example, streaming will fail if the fragments in the stream change from having only video to having
      # both audio and video, or if an AAC audio track is changed to an ALAW audio track. For each streaming
      # session, only 500 CPD changes are allowed. Data retrieved with this action is billable. For
      # information, see Pricing . GetTSFragment: Retrieves MPEG TS fragments containing both initialization
      # and media data for all tracks in the stream. If the ContainerFormat is MPEG_TS , this API is used
      # instead of GetMP4InitFragment and GetMP4MediaFragment to retrieve stream media. Data retrieved with
